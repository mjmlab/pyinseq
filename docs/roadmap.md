This is a loose document on the trajectory of the project and is provided for collaborators and anyone interested. For any problems encountered, though, please see [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) and file any relevant Github issues.

## Highest priority

1. Detailed logging of results at each step.

1. Easy to rerun analyses without requiring demultiplexing of the initial file.

1. Related to the above; straightforward manner to run analyses if samples are already demultiplexed.

1. Improve speed of demultiplexing.

## Wish list

1. Contribution guide for the project.

1. Statistical comparisons of sample outputs.

1. Reporting of summary statistics for each sample (and for pairwise comparisons).

1. Plotting: Need more detailed list of highest priority plots to incorporate.
